#### IDE Settings
This project uses `babel-plugin-module-resolver` to define aliases for directories. If you want your 
IDE to be able to resolve the aliased imports, use `webstorm.config.js` file as a webpack config. 

**JetBrains**

1) Navigate to _YourIDE_ -> Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Webpack
